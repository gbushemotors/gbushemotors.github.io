                <p class="lead">AdBlue is a liquid solution used to treat exhaust gases on modern diesel engines. Its introduced into the exhaust, treatment of diesel exhaust gases in this way allows up to 90% of the produced nitrogen oxides (NOx) by the vehicle to be converted into environmentally friendly components: nitrogen and water. The AdBlue tank needs to be refilled between 10 to 30 thousand kms. If you are presented with an AdBlue level warning, don't ignore this. If your AdBlue tank runs empy, your vehicle will not start. Call in and we will refill it.</p>
